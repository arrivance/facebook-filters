various filters to block certain aspects of facebook and facebook messenger, using your favourite adblocker

## instructions

### facebook_online_block.txt and messenger_online_block.txt
this blocks you from appearing online when using http://messenger.com or http://facebook.com

### facebook_seen_and_type_block.txt and messenger_seen_and_type_block.txt
this prevents messages from being marked as read when you read them on http://facebook.com (facebook_seen), and http://messenger.com (messenger_seen). it also prevents the typing notification

(essentially serves the exact same purpose as [unseen](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/unseen/oclokcfejikeggpnhgakanfbdnlafaon?hl=en), but without any of the ad crap)

### facebook_chat_block.txt
